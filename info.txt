GigFlow?

    GigFlow is a mini freelance marketplace, like a simplified Upwork/Fiverr.
    There are no fixed roles:
    Any user can act as a Client (post jobs)
    Any user can act as a Freelancer (apply to jobs)
    So the same user can:
        Post one job
        Bid on someone else’s job

System Actors

    There are only two logical roles:
    | Role       | What they do                                          |
    | ---------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
    | Client     | Posts a job (Gig), reviews bids, hires one freelancer |
    | Freelancer | Browses jobs and submits bids                         |

     But only a single user can do both,  ** roles are only logical

Authentication Flow

        They require secure login system with:

            JWT
            Stored in HttpOnly cookies
            Flow:
                User signs up
                User logs in // ...
                JWT is stored in cookie
                All protected routes check JWT
                Same user can post or bid

Data Models

    User:
        name
        email
        password
    
    Gig(Job):
        title
        description
        budget
        ownerId   (who posted it)
        status    (open or assigned)
    
    Bid:
        gigId
        freelancerId
        message
        status   (pending, hired, rejected)

Complete System Flow:

    Step 1 – Register & Login
        User signs up → logs in → gets JWT cookie
    
    Step 2 – Post a Gig (Client side)

        User fills:

            Title
            Description
            Budget

            Gig is saved with:
                ownerId = current user
                status = open
        
    Step 3 – Browse Gigs (Freelancer side)
        User sees:
            Only gigs where status = open
            Can search by title
        
    Step 4 – Submit a Bid
        Freelancer enters:
            Message
            Price
            Bid is saved as:
            status = pending
    
    Step 5 – Client views all bids
        Only the owner of the gig can see bids for that gig.
        This uses:
            GET /api/bids/:gigId

    Step 6 – Hiring **
        Client clicks Hire on one bid.
        Then all of this must happen together:
    
        | Action         | What happens      |
        | -------------- | ----------------- |
        | Selected bid   | status = hired    |
        | All other bids | status = rejected |
        | Gig            | status = assigned |
    
    This must be atomic (no double hiring allowed). *** very important


APIs : 
    | Method | Endpoint              |
    | ------ | --------------------- |
    | POST   | /api/auth/register    |
    | POST   | /api/auth/login       |
    | GET    | /api/gigs             |
    | POST   | /api/gigs             |
    | POST   | /api/bids             |
    | GET    | /api/bids/:gigId      |
    | PATCH  | /api/bids/:bidId/hire |



==============================


Bonus 1 – Race condition safety

If two people click hire at same time:

Only ONE must succeed

Other must fail

This requires MongoDB transactions.

Bonus 2 – Real-time

When hired:

Freelancer must instantly receive:

"You have been hired for [Project Name]!"

Using Socket.io


What  must submit

They want:

GitHub repo (full code)

Hosted frontend + backend

.env.example

2-minute Loom video showing:

Login

Create gig

Bid

Hire

Real-time notification
